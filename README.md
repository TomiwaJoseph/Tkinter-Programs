A more fun variation of the hangman game. In this version, you don't hang, instead, you get your score deducted for every wrong choice. It works like this:

- If it is a letter in the randomly selected word, the empty corresponding tile will be replaced with the letter, and points are added to your score

## No. 5 - PlayIt

- Playlist view
- Shortcuts for easy usage experience...
- ...and more
- In short, it works.

NOTE: Incase you pull and run this app and it doesn't work due to the error (AttributeError: module 'collections' has no attribute 'MutableMapping'), don't fret. I found this out too when I changed my machine. According to sources this issue is with python-3.10. Either downgrade your interpreter to a lesser version of python (< python-3.10) and install the requirements.txt or comment out "import stagger" at the top of the script. With the latter the album art for the song playing won't be fetched. Hope python fixes this in the next upgrade 🙁
